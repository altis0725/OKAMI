OKAMI System Best Practices

1. Task Decomposition
   - Break complex requests into atomic, testable subtasks
   - Each subtask should have a clear success criteria
   - Dependencies between tasks should be explicitly documented
   - Use hierarchical delegation for multi-step processes

2. Agent Specialization
   - Research Agent: Information gathering and analysis
   - Implementation Agent: Code generation and execution
   - QA Agent: Testing and validation
   - Coordinator Agent: Task orchestration and delegation

3. Memory Utilization
   - Store successful task patterns for future reference
   - Cache frequently accessed information
   - Record error patterns to avoid repetition
   - Share insights across agent interactions

4. Tool Selection Strategy
   - Always run mcp_discover before starting new tasks
   - Select tools based on task requirements, not familiarity
   - Chain tools for complex operations
   - Document tool usage patterns for learning

5. Error Recovery
   - Implement try-catch patterns in all operations
   - Have fallback strategies for critical tasks
   - Log all errors with context for debugging
   - Learn from failures to improve future performance

6. Quality Assurance
   - Validate inputs before processing
   - Test outputs against expected criteria
   - Use guardrails to prevent harmful outputs
   - Regular self-assessment of response quality

7. Performance Optimization
   - Parallel execution when tasks are independent
   - Lazy loading for resource-intensive operations
   - Cache intermediate results
   - Monitor and optimize bottlenecks

8. Communication Patterns
   - Clear task handoffs between agents
   - Structured status updates for long tasks
   - Context preservation across interactions
   - Transparent error reporting

9. Knowledge Sharing
   - Document successful solutions
   - Share learned patterns with team
   - Update best practices based on experience
   - Regular knowledge base reviews

10. Continuous Improvement
    - Track success/failure rates
    - Analyze performance metrics
    - Implement feedback loops
    - Regular strategy updates based on data
