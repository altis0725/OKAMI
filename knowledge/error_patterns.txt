OKAMI Error Patterns and Troubleshooting

1. Common MCP Tool Errors
   - Error: "Tool not found"
     Solution: Run mcp_discover first to get available tools
   - Error: "Invalid parameters"
     Solution: Check tool signature and required parameters
   - Error: "Timeout exceeded"
     Solution: Break operation into smaller chunks

2. Memory System Issues
   - Error: "Memory provider not configured"
     Solution: Ensure memory_config is set to {"provider": "basic"}
   - Error: "Storage access denied"
     Solution: Check storage directory permissions
   - Error: "Memory overflow"
     Solution: Implement memory cleanup strategies

3. Agent Communication Failures
   - Error: "Agent not responding"
     Solution: Check agent configuration and health
   - Error: "Task delegation failed"
     Solution: Verify agent capabilities match task requirements
   - Error: "Context lost between agents"
     Solution: Ensure proper context passing in delegation

4. API Integration Problems
   - Error: "Monica API authentication failed"
     Solution: Verify MONICA_API_KEY in environment
   - Error: "Rate limit exceeded"
     Solution: Implement exponential backoff
   - Error: "Invalid API response"
     Solution: Add response validation and error handling

5. Task Execution Issues
   - Error: "Task timeout"
     Solution: Increase timeout or break into subtasks
   - Error: "Circular dependency"
     Solution: Review task dependencies and refactor
   - Error: "Resource exhaustion"
     Solution: Implement resource monitoring and limits

6. Quality Check Failures
   - Error: "Response quality below threshold"
     Solution: Review guardrail rules and adjust parameters
   - Error: "Hallucination detected"
     Solution: Increase fact-checking and validation
   - Error: "Inconsistent outputs"
     Solution: Standardize response formats

7. Docker Environment Issues
   - Error: "Container startup failed"
     Solution: Check logs and environment variables
   - Error: "Network connectivity issues"
     Solution: Verify Docker network configuration
   - Error: "Volume mount failures"
     Solution: Check file permissions and paths

8. Debugging Strategies
   - Enable debug logging for detailed traces
   - Use structured logging for easier parsing
   - Implement correlation IDs for request tracking
   - Regular log rotation to prevent disk issues

9. Recovery Procedures
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Graceful degradation for non-critical features
   - State persistence for recovery after crashes
   - Health checks for early problem detection

10. Prevention Best Practices
    - Input validation at all entry points
    - Regular system health monitoring
    - Automated testing for common scenarios
    - Documentation of known issues and solutions
